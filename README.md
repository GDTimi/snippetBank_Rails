# snippetBank_Rails
snippetBank() is an app for collecting useful code snippets.

The original version was written in PHP (https://github.com/GDTimi/snippetBank), this is a rebuild using Ruby on Rails.

App is currently _under construction_ - usage / build instructions will be added when it is in a usable state!
